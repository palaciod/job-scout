# Job Scout üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Only**: This project currently supports Windows only due to native C++ automation tools. Cross-platform support is planned for future releases.

An intelligent automated job discovery and evaluation system for LinkedIn. Job Scout automatically scans through job postings, filters promising opportunities, and uses AI to evaluate how well they match your profile - saving you hours of manual job searching.

## üéØ What It Does

Job Scout **does not apply to jobs automatically**. Instead, it:

- üîç **Discovers Jobs**: Automatically navigates LinkedIn job search results
- üéØ **Smart Filtering**: Applies initial criteria (fewer than 100 applicants, avoids low-quality job boards)
- üìã **Data Extraction**: Captures full job descriptions for promising opportunities
- ü§ñ **AI Evaluation**: Uses local LLM to assess job fit based on your profile
- ÔøΩÔ∏è **Web Interface**: Modern React application for managing and reviewing discovered jobs
- ÔøΩüìä **Structured Results**: Saves all evaluations in organized format for easy review

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. Web Application (`job-scout-app/front-end/`)
- **Modern React Interface**: Built with React 19 and Material-UI
- **Job Management**: View, filter, and organize discovered jobs
- **Resume Integration**: Upload resume for personalized job matching
- **Company Filtering**: Block unwanted companies and job boards
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle
- **Responsive Design**: Grid and list view options

### 2. Scout Bot (`scout-bot/`)
- Node.js automation script that controls the entire workflow
- Orchestrates screenshot capture, computer vision, and job evaluation
- Handles LinkedIn page navigation and data extraction

### 3. Mouse Tools (`mouse-tools/`) üñ±Ô∏è **Windows Only**
- Collection of **native C++ utilities** for precise browser automation:
  - **Screenshot capture** - Captures specific screen regions with pixel-perfect accuracy
  - **Mouse movement** - Smooth, human-like cursor automation with safety controls
  - **Text highlighting** - Automatic text selection and copying
  - **OCR detection** - Finds text in images using Tesseract OCR
  - **Template matching** - Computer vision to locate UI elements (OpenCV)
  - **Scrolling** - Programmatic page navigation
  - **Global hotkeys** - Emergency stop functionality (ESC key)
- **Dependencies**: OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, Windows API, MSYS2/MinGW-w64
- **Performance**: Native C++ for millisecond-precise timing and smooth automation

### 4. Job Evaluation Server (`job-scout-app/server/`)
- Express.js API server for job analysis
- Integrates with local LLM (LM Studio) for intelligent evaluation
- Provides structured job data extraction and fit assessment
- Serves data to the React frontend application
