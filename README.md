# Job Scout üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

An intelligent automated job discovery and evaluation system for LinkedIn. Job Scout automatically scans through job postings, filters promising opportunities, and uses AI to evaluate how well they match your profile - saving you hours of manual job searching.

## üéØ What It Does

Job Scout **does not apply to jobs automatically**. Instead, it:

- üîç **Discovers Jobs**: Automatically navigates LinkedIn job search results
- üéØ **Smart Filtering**: Applies initial criteria (fewer than 100 applicants, avoids low-quality job boards)
- üìã **Data Extraction**: Captures full job descriptions for promising opportunities
- ü§ñ **AI Evaluation**: Uses local LLM to assess job fit based on your profile
- ÔøΩÔ∏è **Web Interface**: Modern React application for managing and reviewing discovered jobs
- ÔøΩüìä **Structured Results**: Saves all evaluations in organized format for easy review

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. Web Application (`job-scout-app/front-end/`)
- **Modern React Interface**: Built with React 19 and Material-UI
- **Job Management**: View, filter, and organize discovered jobs
- **Resume Integration**: Upload resume for personalized job matching
- **Company Filtering**: Block unwanted companies and job boards
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle
- **Responsive Design**: Grid and list view options

### 2. Scout Bot (`scout-bot/`)
- Node.js automation script that controls the entire workflow
- Orchestrates screenshot capture, computer vision, and job evaluation
- Handles LinkedIn page navigation and data extraction

### 3. Mouse Tools (`mouse-tools/`)
- Collection of C++ utilities for browser automation:
  - **Screenshot capture** - Captures specific screen regions
  - **Mouse movement** - Smooth cursor automation with safety controls
  - **Text highlighting** - Automatic text selection and copying
  - **OCR detection** - Finds text in images using Tesseract
  - **Template matching** - Computer vision to locate UI elements
  - **Scrolling** - Programmatic page navigation

### 4. Job Evaluation Server (`job-scout-app/server/`)
- Express.js API server for job analysis
- Integrates with local LLM (LM Studio) for intelligent evaluation
- Provides structured job data extraction and fit assessment
- Serves data to the React frontend application

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Super Simple Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd job-scout
   ```

2. **Start everything with one command**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Setup LM Studio**
   - Install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
   - Download a model (recommended: Llama3-8b)
   - Start the local server on `http://127.0.0.1:1234`

That's it! The script will:
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Start the backend server  
- ‚úÖ Start the React frontend
- ‚úÖ Open the web interface at `http://localhost:3001`

### Alternative Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies only

npm run dev
```

### Legacy Scripts (Alternative)

If you prefer the original batch/shell scripts:

```bash
# Windows
install.bat
start.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x install.sh start.sh
./install.sh
./start.sh
```

### Manual Setup

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T...",
  "job": {
    "title": "Senior Full Stack Developer",
    "company": "TechCorp Inc.",
    "technologies": ["React", "Node.js", "AWS"],
    "experienceLevel": "Mid",
    "remote": true,
    "summary": "Building scalable web applications...",

### Safety Features
- Global escape key listener for immediate stop
- Smooth mouse movements to avoid detection
- Error handling and retry logic for robustness

### LLM Integration
